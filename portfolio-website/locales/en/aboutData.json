    "about_description": "I am a Computer Engineer with 4 years of Full Stack development experience, driven by continuous improvement and a strong interest in emerging technologies. On the backend, I develop RESTful APIs using .NET Core, and efficiently utilize SQL databases along with cloud services such as AWS S3. I manage CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions and prioritize sustainability by writing Unit Tests for every piece of code. On the frontend, I build fast, user-centric, and modern interfaces with React and TypeScript, while adhering to UI/UX principles. I actively contribute to projects that involve transforming multi-layered desktop ERP applications into modern web-based architectures by applying software design patterns such as Clean Architecture. Additionally, I develop corporate websites using Next.js as a freelancer. My strongest assets are my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and dedication to software quality.",
