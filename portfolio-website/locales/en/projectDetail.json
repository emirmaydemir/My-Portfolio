      "description_title": "Project Description",
      "description": "This website was developed specifically for a stainless steel bolt and nut supplier using React and Next.js technologies. The main reason for choosing Next.js over a traditional SPA built with React is that React applications cannot fully hide their source code and are not well optimized for search engines. Thanks to Next.js's **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** feature, page contents are delivered as HTML, which provides significant SEO advantages. This allows search engines to better crawl and index the page content.|While React is a powerful library for building user interfaces, it has certain limitations in terms of SEO. The primary reason is its use of a virtual DOM, which prevents the browser from displaying fully rendered HTML during the initial load, making it difficult for search engines to detect the content. In this project, these limitations are minimized through the SSR approach provided by Next.js. Additionally, rich meta tags, JSON-LD structured data, and semantic HTML were utilized to make the content more SEO-friendly. Integrations with Google Search Console, Analytics, and Ads were implemented to enhance performance tracking and marketing effectiveness.|As part of the SEO efforts, keyword analysis was conducted to target the appropriate audience, and the pages were structured accordingly. To ensure fast image loading, all media content was hosted on the **Cloudinary** platform, reducing server load. Moreover, hosting was planned through cloud-based services like AWS Amplify, achieving a high-performance and scalable infrastructure. As a result, the project successfully combines strong user experience with a technically robust and SEO-optimized web platform.",

      "description_title": "Project Description",
      "description": "Developed using Java in the Android Studio environment, this mobile application aims to solve a common real-world problem: reducing expenses by comparing product prices across different stores. The app allows users to easily find the products they’re looking for and instantly access pricing information from various retailers. It also calculates the total cost of items in the shopping cart, helping users save time by eliminating the need to visit multiple stores and avoid unexpected prices at checkout.|Thanks to JDBC and Firebase integrations, the application allows manufacturers to add product data, while end users can access real-time price comparisons and detailed product information. With QR code and mobile payment technologies, users benefit from both time and cost savings. Additionally, user reviews of products are stored in the Firebase database, enabling users to share their experiences and help others make more informed purchasing decisions. Thus, the app not only offers price comparisons but also becomes a comprehensive shopping guide enriched with social feedback. |To optimize data access and speed up search operations, the HashMap data structure is used. HashMap works on a key-value basis, allowing fast and efficient data queries through unique identifiers such as product names or barcodes. This way, when a user enters a keyword, the application retrieves the relevant information instantly without scanning the entire dataset, thereby improving performance.|The app also uses the LinkedList data structure to dynamically manage the shopping cart. This allows users to add and remove products efficiently without shifting other elements. The Stack data structure is used to provide undo functionality, enabling users to easily restore accidentally deleted items. All of these data structures are combined with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to enhance the application's performance, flexibility, and overall user experience.",
